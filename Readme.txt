Hi There!, This is a Readme file to guide how to run & apply Arduino Code to our Final Year Project

"Gesture Controlled Robotic Wheelchair"

1. Run "GCRW.ino" on Arduino IDE.

2. Connect the Arduino Cable with the Arduino attached in the Wheelchair.

3. Select the Connected Port e.g "COM-7, COM-13", Select Board "Arduino Uno" from tools option in tabbar.

4. Click "Compile", and then click "Upload".

5. Wait for Arduino to be Programmed Successfully.

6. Remove the cable and Switch on the Wheelchair. (Make Sure Batteries are already charged)

7. The Wheelchair will now start to work as Programmed.


Thanks!
